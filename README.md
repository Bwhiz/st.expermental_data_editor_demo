# st.expermental_data_editor_demo

This is my solution to the second challenge of the [streamlit student ambassadors](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/our-new-education-programs/34304).

The challenge is to create an app using the newly launched ["experimental_data_editor"](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.experimental_data_editor) in streamlit (1.19.0).
In this app , I leveraged on the use case of the function above to build a "task monitoring app", users get to list tasks or schedules for the day and have the ability to tick
off tasks they've completed while seeing a list of pending tasks to complete.

This simple app is hosted [here](https://bwhiz-st-expermental-data-editor-demo-main-c4urj2.streamlit.app/).

A snapshot of the app is shown below:
